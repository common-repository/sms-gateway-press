Self-hosted SMS Gateway. Send SMS with your own Android devices across your WordPress site.

== Description ==

This plugin extends the capabilities of WordPress to turn it into a complete text messaging (SMS) gateway.

Features:

1. Add endpoints to the Rest API to send and check the status of SMS.
2. Allows you to connect an unlimited number of Android devices. The more devices connected, the higher the availability of the gateway.
3. Customized sending. Since SMS are sent with the mobile lines of Android devices, the costs applied will depend on them. It's good to keep in mind that in many countries local text messages are free.
4. Shows real-time and refined information on the status of devices as well as SMS.
5. Allows you to schedule SMS sending.
